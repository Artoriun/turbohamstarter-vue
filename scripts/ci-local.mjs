/**
 * Runs locally what CI runs, in CI's order, derived from the workflow itself.
 *
 * Not a hand-written list. A hand-written list is a fourth copy of the pipeline to keep in
 * sync, and the whole reason this exists is that copies drift: a sibling repo blocked a
 * deploy because the command run locally was `playwright test <one spec>` while the command
 * CI ran was `npm run test:e2e:dist`, which is the whole suite. Same intent, different
 * command, different result.
 *
 * Steps come from `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in order, so adding a CI step adds it here for
 * free. Anything needing a browser, a secret or the network in a way that cannot work on a
 * developer's machine is skipped with a reason rather than silently dropped.
 *
 * Usage: npm run ci            everything
 *        npm run ci -- --list  show what would run
